          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            A week after Audai passed away, I (Audai’s father) woke up
            remembering an incident in 1991 when Audai was only six years old. We
            were taking a walk as a family on a Saturday afternoon to pick up a
            few books when suddenly I noticed Audai was missing. I looked back
            and saw him talking to a homeless man a few yards behind us. He ran
            back to me and asked for some money, “Dad, the man over there is
            hungry, and the money can help buy his lunch.” From his childhood to
            his last breath, Audai lived by that example, always wanting to make
            someone happy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            A few days later, I went to his bank to inform his death. When I
            pulled his wallet to get his bank card, I found a little card with a
            prayer for generosity from St. Ignatius Loyola. At that very
            moment, I knew he wanted us to continue the charitable work that he
            was so passionate about. He always said, “Life is better when you
            are happy, but life is best when others are happy because of you.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            At only 36, Audai passed away at the prime of his life in a tragic
            accident. He was a great loss to family, friends, colleagues, and
            everyone who had the benefit to know him. He was passionate about
            life while keeping a healthy lifestyle through running and joining
            local sports teams. Audai was an empathetic leader who cared for
            those in need and was a true humanitarian who made an impact in
            communities near and far. From taking care of expenses for a medical
            student in Sri Lanka, building a home for a single mother to
            providing weekly meals to LA homeless, and supporting meals for
            an orphan children in Sudan, Audai gave all he could in hopes of a
            better world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            Audai grew up in Mountain View, California. After graduating high
            school, Audai attended George Washington University. He received a
            Bachelor of Science in International Economics followed by a Master
            of Arts in Communication, Culture and Technology at Georgetown
            University. He was an avid leader, high school, and college student
            body president. A few weeks before his passing, he started his
            pollical career in the neighborhood city council because he wanted
            to take a significant role in eradicating homelessness in Los
Angeles. Audai loved to read, knew his way around words, and was a
            beautiful storyteller who would light up any room he stepped in. At
            6 feet 7, Audai was a kind giant who made people feel that anything
            in life was possible if you believed in yourself.
